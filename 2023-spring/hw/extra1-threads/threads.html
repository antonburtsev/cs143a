Output:<h1>HW6: User Level Threads</h1>

<p>This assignment will teach you to build a minimal scheduler and a threading system.
You can do this assignment on any Linux system, you do not need xv6. 
Submit your programs
and the shell through Gradescope (see instructions at the bottom of this page). 

<p><b>NOTE: YOU CANNOT PUBLICLY RELEASE SOLUTIONS TO THIS HOMEWORK</b>. It's ok to show 
your work to your future employer as a private Git repo, however any public release is prohibited. 

<p>
This assignment introduces you to the notion of threads, context switching and
scheduling. 

<p>Before starting to work on your thread implementation, you should understand
what threads are. Here is a good link that introduces POSIX threads that you
have to develop (you don't have to read all of it, just get the basic idea of
what threads are and how they work): <a
href="https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/pthreads/">https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/pthreads/</a>.
If you feel like it you can also read a couple of chapters from the OSTEP book:
<a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/threads-intro.pdf">Concurrency:
An Introduction</a> and <a
href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/threads-api.pdf">Interlude: Thread
API</a>

<p>The take-away idea for threads: threads are very much like processes (they
can run in parallel on different physical CPUs), but they share the same address
space (the address space of the process that created them). Hence all threads
of the same process can read and update the all variables in that address space
to communicate and collaborate on computing a complex result in parallel. 

<p>While threads share the same address space they each need their own stack as
they might execute entirely different code in the program (call different
functions with different arguments --- all this information has to be preserved
for each thread individually, hence they need different stacks. 

<p>Now it's time to take a look at the implementation of user-level threads we will 
be working with. Download all the files in the <a href=./src/>src</a> folder and  
 and look over them (you can use <a href=./src/Makefile>Makefile</a> to build them). 

 <p>Our implementation uses one POSIX thread of the Linux system instead of a CPU (but 
 it's not hard to extend it to a multi-threaded implementation on top of POSIX threads, i.e., 
 just invoke the schedule function in multiple threads and run our threads similar to how xv6 
 does it on multiple CPUs). We do not  support preemptive scheduling, i.e., there is no timer interrupt or a signal delivered, 
 threads explicitly yield to each other. 

	
The <<a href=./src/threads.c>threads.c</a> file provides a simple implementation for user-level threads.
Specifically, you can create a new <tt>thread</tt> with the
<tt>u_thread_create()</tt> function.  The
<tt>u_thread_create()</tt> has the following signature (it's very similar to
the thread creation function in the POSIX standard. 

<pre> 
int u_thread_create(void (*fn)(void *), void *arg);
</pre>

The <tt>u_thread_create()</tt> call creates a new user thread that runs inside
the same process (in contrast to the kernel thread implementation, the
<tt>u_thread_create()</tt> doesn't invoke a single system call, but instead
just executes the function that is passed as an argument (<tt>fn</tt>) on the
already allocated stack (<tt>stack</tt>). The function pointed by the
<tt>fn</tt> pointer takes a void pointer as an argument (it's passed inside
<tt>u_thread_create()</tt> as <tt>arg</tt>. The new user thread runs until it
		explicitly yields execution back to the parent with the <tt>u_yield()</tt>
		call. The <tt>u_yield()</tt> call doesn't do a single system call, but saves
execution of the thread on the stack and switches back to the parent process
(i.e., it continues execution at the line immediately following the
<tt>u_thread_create()</tt> invocation. 

You can then create and run multiple user threads like this: 

<pre>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "threads.h"

void do_work(void *arg) {
   int i; 
   for (i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
       printf("I'm in %s\n", (char *)arg);
       u_yield();
   }
};

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    char a1[] = "Thread 1";
    char a2[] = "Thread 2";

    u_thread_create(do_work, (void*)a1);
    u_thread_create(do_work, (void*)a2); 

    u_sched();
    printf("Threads finished\n");
    return 0;
}
</pre>

The program above will produce: 
<pre>
I'm in Thread 1
I'm in Thread 2
I'm in Thread 1
I'm in Thread 2
Threads finished
</pre>

<h1>Part 1: Add scheduling</h1>

Now you have to change the scheduling logic to the system above. Specifically, you
should change the <tt>u_sched()</tt> function in the <a href="./src/threads.c">threads.c</a> 
file that will schedule your threads in a <em>fair</em> manner, 
i.e., even if one thread yields twice as
often as another, both threads should get the same fraction of the CPU time,
i.e., 50%. In other words if you have two work functions and one spins for
1,000,000 times adding an integer in each iteration of a loop, and then prints
something on the screen, and then yields, and another work function that does
the same but spins 2,000,000 times before printing and yielding, you should see
2x more prints from the first function on the screen -- it's fair, since the
first function runs for only half the time of the second one, and deserves to
be scheduled twice as often to get a fair fraction of the CPU time. 

The <tt>u_sched()</tt> function should implement the scheduling logic, i.e.,
track time, context switch to the next thread that ran the least, etc. It exits
only when all thread finish. 

You can keep the track of time with the <tt>__rdtsc()</tt> function (see example in 
<a href="./src/threads.c">threads.c</a>). 


<h1>Part 2: Implement Join</h1>

You should implement the <tt>int u_thread_join(void)</tt> that waits for a child 
thread. It returns the process id of waited-for child or -1 if none. Note you should keep track of 
parent-child relationship, so parents can wait on children, and well, also make sure threads can create children recursively. 

Note that my implementation does not deallocate resources on exit, yours should (we will test 
on creating more than <tt>MAX_THREADS </tt> threads, and will test recursive thread creation and join).
