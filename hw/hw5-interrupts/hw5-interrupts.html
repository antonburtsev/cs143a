<h1>HW5: Interrupts</h1>

<p>This homework asks you to extend your "hello world" kernel with support for handling timer interupts. 
This assignments builds on top of your 
previous HW3 and HW4 submissions</b>, i.e., you will extend the code of HW3 
to implement this additional functionality for HW4. If you don't have a working HW3 submission 
talk to us. 

<p>
Technically, you can do this assignment on any
operating system that supports the Unix API and can run Qemu (CADE
machines, your laptop that runs Linux or Linux VM, and even MacOS, etc.).
<b>You don't need to set up xv6 for this assignment</b>, but <b>if you're running
on CADE you'll have to install QEMU</b>, see <a href="../xv6-setup.html">QEMU 
setup instructions</a>. Submit your programs
and the shell through Gradescope (see instructions at the bottom of this page). 

<p><b>NOTE: YOU CANNOT PUBLICLY RELEASE SOLUTIONS TO THIS HOMEWORK</b>. It's ok to show 
your work to your future employer as a private Git repo, however any public release is prohibited. 


<h2>Overview</h2>

At a high level our goal is to learn how to construct an interrupt descriptor table and the low-level 
code for managing the interrupt entry and exit. 

First, download <a href="./src/ioapic.c">./src/ioapic.c</a>, <a href="./src/lapic.c">./src/lapic.c</a>, 
<a href="./src/picirq.c">./src/picirq.c</a> files from the <a href="./src/">./src</a> folder. 
These three files contain the code for initializing three interrupt controllers. The legacy programmable 
interrupt controller (PIC), the new local advanced programmable interrupt controller (LAPIC) and 
the Intel I/O Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (ioapic). We skip details of the 
initialization, and instead simply do the following two steps. 

You need to map the memory region that communicates with the LAPIC controller, specifically 
addresses 0xfec00000 -- one to one. After mapping this memory region you can download 
the <a href="./src/trap.c">./src/trap.c</a> and <a href="./src/traps.h">./src/traps.h</a> and invoke 
the <code>initpics()</code> function from your <code>main<code>. 

This will initialize all three controllers and enable delivery of the timer interrupt. 

<h2>Configuring IDT</h2>



<h2>Page memory allocator</h2>

Our first task is to implement a simple page memory allocator. At a high level
your assignment is to implement two functions: <code>page_alloc()</code> and
<code>page_free(int pa)</code>. The <code>int page_alloc()</code> function should
return a physical address of a free page as integer. Similarly,
<code>page_free(int pa)</code> takes a physical address of the page and adds it
back to the pool of free physical pages. 

<p> Now, we need a way to keep track of available physical pages. We will implement 
this data structure as an array (each element of the array represents one physical 
page) linked with a list so we can quickly allocate the next available page.

Specifically, we will use the following data structure to keep track of 
physical pages in the system:

<pre>
#define MAX_PAGES 8
#define NIL 0xFFFFFFFF

struct page {
    unsigned int next;
};

struct free_pages {
    unsigned int head;
    struct page pages[MAX_PAGES];
};

unsigned int page_alloc(); 
void page_free(unsinged int pa); 
</pre>


Here the pages array tracks the state of every page in the system. Each 
element of the array corresponds to a single page. Page with physical page number (ppn) of 
0 (address 0x0), is element 0 of the array, ppn 1 is element 1, etc. The next field links the 
free pages as illustrated below (the example for MAX_PAGES of 8).
 
The head points to the 5th element of the array (this means that page with ppn 5 is 
free, and the next page on the list is page with ppn 1, and the last page on the list is 
page with ppn 3.) Here we use NIL (a constant that identifies an invalid next pointer) to specify the end of the list. 

<pre>
head: 5 --------------+     
              +---+   |     
              |   |   |  
              |   v   v     
           -----------------
           | |3| |N| |1| | |
           -----------------
            0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 
              ^       |     
	      |       |
              +-------+

</pre>

The <code>page_alloc()</code> function should return physical address of the page with ppn 5, 
and will update the list like this: 

<pre>
head: 1 -+     
         |    +---+        
         |    |   |     
         |    |   v        
         | -----------------
         | | |3| |N| | | | |
         | -----------------
         |  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 
         |    ^
         |    |            
         +----+
</pre>

The <code>page_free(unsigned int pa)</code> function takes the physical address of the page, and adds this page 
back to the free list. For example, if you invoke <code>page_free(0x7000)</code> the list changes like: 

<pre>
head: 7 ------------------+     
              +---+       | 
              |   |       |
              |   v       v 
           -----------------
           | |3| |N| | | |1|
           -----------------
            0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 
              ^           |
              |           | 
              +-----------+
</pre>


You assignment is to implement this linked list to support 32MB of physical memory. Similar to 
xv6 you should add the <code>end</code> symbol to your kernel (remember, you have to change the 
linker script to export this symbol, and an extern declaration in C), add pages from the 
kernel end to the 32MB to your allocator.  To add the <code>end</code> symbol to your linker script, 
use something like 

<pre>
PROVIDE(end = .);
</pre>

Similar to <a href=https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public/blob/master/kernel.ld>kernel.ld</a> in xv6.
</p>
 

<h2>Mapping a page</h2>

<p>Having a memory allocator working, we are ready to construct the address space (i.e., a page 
table) with our new mapping function:

<pre>
int mmap(pde_t *pgdir, unsigned int va, unsigned int pa, unsigned int flag)
</pre>

This function takes a pointer to the page table directory and maps
the page with the physical address <code>pa</code> to the virtual address <code>va</code>. If the inner levels of the page 
table are not present you should allocate and add them to the page table. 

Your assignment is to implement the <code>mmap()</code> function. 

<h2> Test </h2>

<p> 
  First, download <a href="./src/pagealloc.c">pagealloc.c</a>. Add to your hw3. 
  All your code for this hw should be in this file. The <code>Makefiile</code> will 
  automatically pick up all <code>.c</code> files and compile them. 
</p>

<p> 
  Second, download <a href="./src/test.c">test.c</a>. This contains definition of test method that 
  will call your implementation of <code>mmap()</code> and <code>page_free()</code> method to create a new mapping from 0 - 32 MB.
  Then modify your <code>main()</code> function to call <code>test()</code> after setting the page table and before invocation 
  of <code>halt()</code>. 
</p>


<h2>Hints</h2>

To finish the homework you can follow the code of xv6 - kalloc.c (in fact it's allowed to copy and paste code from 
xv6 verbatim if it helps you). 

<h2>FAQ</h2>


<h3>What is the point of setting up a page allocator if we can set up paging like in hw3?</h3>

Page allocator represents amount of physical memory in your system. This abstraction will allow 
us to do other things in the next homework, such as allocate pages to load an executable in memory. 

<h3>Why don't we use other approach to setting up page allocator, such as a bitmap?</h3>

You can. But it is slow. In a 32bit system, you will need to keep track of 2^20 = 1,048,576 number of pages. 
The allocation can get very slow due to a long scan of the bitmap. The linked list is always <code>O(1)</code> 
and the constant is small. 

<h3>What should my page_alloc return?</h3>

A physical address of the page, i.e., it has to be PGSIZE or 4096 aligned.

<h3>Should I call <code>page_alloc()</code> in my <code>mmap()</code>? </h3>

Yes, remember your pagetable is a tree. Even if the top level of the tree is allocated, 
the inner levels (page tables) will need some space, i.e., a physical page that you should 
get from <code>mmap()</code>. 

<h3>What is purpose of <code>end</code> symbol?</h3>

The <code>end</code> symbol helps us to initialize your allocator correctly. Specifically, the <code>end</code> symbol 
marks the end of the kernel binary, i.e., its text, data, bss and potentially other sections, in memory. 
We don't want to add physical pages in which the kernel is allocated to the allocator and reuse them for something else. 

<h3>I don't have a working HW3</h3>

<p>If you don't have a working HW3 (Boot Into C) homework, talk to us. We will either debug your solution, or give you ours.</p>
