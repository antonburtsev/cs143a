<h1>HW5: Interrupts</h1>


<p>This homework asks you to extend your "hello world" kernel with support for
handling timer interupts. This assignments builds on top of your previous HW3
and HW4 submissions</b>, i.e., you will extend the code of HW3 to implement
this additional functionality for HW4. If you don't have a working HW4
submission talk to us. 

<p>
Technically, you can do this assignment on any
operating system that supports the Unix API and can run Qemu (CADE
machines, your laptop that runs Linux or Linux VM, and even MacOS, etc.).
<b>You don't need to set up xv6 for this assignment</b>, but <b>if you're running
on CADE you'll have to install QEMU</b>, see <a href="../xv6-setup.html">QEMU 
setup instructions</a>. Submit your programs
and the shell through Gradescope (see instructions at the bottom of this page). 

<p><b>NOTE: YOU CANNOT PUBLICLY RELEASE SOLUTIONS TO THIS HOMEWORK</b>. It's ok to show 
your work to your future employer as a private Git repo, however any public release is prohibited. 


<h2>Overview</h2>

At a high level our goal is to learn how to construct an interrupt descriptor
table and the low-level code for managing the interrupt entry and exit. 



<h2>Configuring interrupt controllers </h2>


Download <a href="./src/ioapic.c">ioapic.c</a>, <a href="./src/lapic.c">lapic.c</a>, 
and <a href="./src/picirq.c">picirq.c</a> files. 
These three files contain the code for initializing three interrupt controllers. The legacy programmable 
interrupt controller (PIC), the new local advanced programmable interrupt controller (LAPIC) and 
the Intel I/O Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (ioapic). We skip details of the 
initialization, and instead simply do the following two steps. 


First, you need to map two memory regions that allow communication with the LAPIC and IOAPIC controllers. Both 
controllers use memory-mapped I/O to communicate with hardware, i.e., a load or store in memory is translated into 
an I/O bus transaction that reaches the hardware. 

Specifically we need to map two virtual pages one to one to the same physical addresses: 

<pre>
DEFAULT_IOAPIC: 0xfec00000 -> 0xfec00000
DEFAULT_LAPIC: 0xfee00000 -> 0xfee00000
</pre> 

After mapping this memory region you can download the <a href="./src/trap.c">./src/trap.c</a> and <a href="./src/traps.h">./src/traps.h</a> files and invoke 
the <code>initpics()</code> function from your <code>main</code>. This will initialize all three controllers and enable delivery of the timer interrupt. 

<h2>Configuring IDT</h2>

<p>
In this assignment your goal is to implement the <code>tvinit()</code> function in trap.c. Let us first understand IDT. IDT 
	stands for Interrupt Description Table. The layout of the table is similar to GDT. However, the role 
	of IDT is to configure all interrupts. Each entry in IDT describes a specific interrupt. The timer is delivered via interrupt 
vector 32. 

</p>


Similar to xv6 we will use an array to represent IDT. You can read about 
IDT format here: <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Interrupt_Descriptor_Table">OSDev: interrupt descriptor table</a>.

<pre>
struct gatedesc idt[256];
</pre>

The table is an array that is pointed by the LDTR register. 
Each entry is 64bits, and describes a specific interrupt in following format.

<pre>
struct gatedesc {
	uint off_15_0 : 16;   // low 16 bits of offset in segment
	uint cs : 16;         // code segment selector
	uint args : 5;        // # args, 0 for interrupt/trap gates
	uint rsv1 : 3;        // reserved(should be zero I guess)
	uint type : 4;        // type(STS_{IG32,TG32})
	uint s : 1;           // must be 0 (system)
	uint dpl : 2;         // descriptor(meaning new) privilege level
	uint p : 1;           // Present
	uint off_31_16 : 16;  // high bits of offset in segment
};
</pre>

For example, in order to enable a keyboard interrupt (#33), we will do set the entry 33 of IDT. To simplify 
things, we provide a macro SETGATE in traps.h. You can use like so to point keyboard interrupt to jmp to ADDR.

<pre>
SETGATE(idt[T_IRQ0 + IRQ_KBD], 0, CS, ADDR, DPL);
</pre>

<p>
Your job is to initlize IDT with timer interrupt 32. We will implement vector32 in assembly similar to xv6 to make sure 
we save all the user state correctly. 
	
<p>
Once IDT is properly initilized, you can go ahead and use a helper function <code>lidt()</code> to load the IDT in the hardware 
register IDTR. 

<p> To enable delivery of interrupts you can use the <code>sti()</code> helper which sets the interrupt flag (IF) in the EFLAGS 
register. You can enable the interrupts right at the end of the <code>main()</code> function. 


<p>
Note, since interrupts will wake up the system from the halted state you need to make sure that you re-enter the halt again. Otherwise 
you will exit from <code>main()</code> and crash. Make sure that you change the end of the <code>main()</code> function to 
enter the halt in an infinite loop. 
</p>

<pre>
for(;;)
  halt()
</pre>


<h2> Getting to Trap </h2>

<p>
Now lets take a look at how we can implement the low-level interrupt entry and exit code. 
Download <a href="./src/vectors.asm">./src/vectors.asm</a>. This file will provide a skeleton 
for <code>alltrap</code>, <code>trapret</code>, and <code>vector32</code>. We will implement them 
similar to xv6 but in Intel assembly. 

<p>
The high-level goal is to save all low level state (registers) and then call the <code>trap()</code> 
function in trap.c. 

<p>
In order to call <code>trap()</code>, we need to save user context onto trap frame, so we can properly 
return to user code. The trapframe is defined in <a href="./src/traps.h">traps.h</a> -- we use a data 
structure that carefully defines all the fields in such a manner that they match the layout of the stack 
where we save all register state. 
</p>

<pre>
struct trapframe {
	// registers as pushed by pusha
	uint edi;
	uint esi;
	uint ebp;
	uint oesp;      
	uint ebx;
	uint edx;
	uint ecx;
	uint eax;

	// rest of trap frame
	ushort gs;
	ushort padding1;
	ushort fs;
	ushort padding2;
	ushort es;
	ushort padding3;
	ushort ds;
	ushort padding4;
	uint trapno;

	// below here defined by x86 hardware
	uint err;
	uint eip;
	ushort cs;
	ushort padding5;
	uint eflags;

	// below here only when crossing rings, such as from user to kernel
	uint esp;
	ushort ss;
	ushort padding6;
};
</pre>

<p>We borrow this data structure from xv6. 

<p>
To save all register state, we need to implement an entry point for the interrupt vector 32, i.e., an assembly label 
<code>vector32</code> in vectors.asm. 
This is the address we use when we configure the interrupt descriptor table. 

<p>
In vector32, similar to xv6 we will save an error code and the trap number on the stack.  This will later be used 
by <code>trap()</code> to tell which specific interrupt we are handling (Yes, giant switch statement :( !).

<p>
Similar to xv6 we will jump to the generic assembly function <code>alltrap</code> to save all other registers. The reason why 
we implement alltraps seperately because this is the common (reuseable code) that can be called 
by all the interrupts. In xv6, they use a perl script to generate all the vectors rather than 
write them out manually, but we will write one <code>vector32</code> by hand. 

</p>

<pre>
global vector32
vector32:
	push 0
	push 32
	jmp alltraps
</pre>

<p>
The alltrap label can look like this (don't forget to define SEG_KDATA to match the right entry in the GDT): 
</p>

<pre>
alltraps:
	; Build trap frame.
	push ds
	push es
	push fs
	push gs
	pusha

	; Set up data segments.
	mov ax, SEG_KDATA
	mov ds, ax
	mov es, ax

	; Call trap(tf), where tf=%esp
	push esp
	call trap
	add esp, 4
</pre>

<p>
	In order to return from the interrupt, we must implement the trapret function, which first 
	deallocates space on the stack and then calls iret. Look at the trapframe data structure to 
understand how we restore the registers that we saved upon the interrupt entry on the stack.
</p>

<pre>
; Return falls through to trapret...
trapret:
	popa
	pop gs
	pop fs
	pop es
	pop ds
	add esp, 8  ; trapno and errcode
	iret
</pre>
	Now  everything is set up.  Your job is to implement the functions above and the  <code>trap()</code> function in trap.c in such 
a manner that  
	whenever the timer interrupt is called, it will call <code>printk(".")</code> to print a dot on the serial line. Make sure that 
you call <code>lapiceoi()</code> to acknowledge the interrupt right after you print the dot on the serial line.
</p>


<h2>
Back to <code>main()</code>
</h2>

<p> 
Be sure add a infinite
	loop around your halt so it will keep halting after retuning from interrupt. To keep you on track, 
	your main should look like this (psuedo code below, copy at your own risk!)
</p>

<pre>
int main(void)
{

	// Set up Page Table
	pagetable_init(); 

	// Initialize the console
	uartinit(); 

	// Initialize PICs
	initpics();

	// Initialize IDT, load IDT, enable interrupt
	tvinit();

	// Halt
	for(;;)
		halt(); 
}
</pre>

<h2>Helping reading and additional resources</h2>

The following links provide a detailed description of the interrupt handling code in xv6 (remember we re-use bits of xv6 in this 
homework assignment, so pretty much everything can work in a manner similar to xv6).

<h2>Submit your work</h2>

<p>
To make sure you didn't just <code>printk(".")</code> in main, you only need to submit partial files, and we will replace our implementation 
with those files. So make sure you follow the guide, and not add additional global variables or functions to those files as it might 
conflict with our solution.
</p>

Submit your solution through Gradescope CS5460/6460 Operating Systems</a>. <b>Please zip all of your files and submit them.</b>

The structure of the zip file should be the following:
