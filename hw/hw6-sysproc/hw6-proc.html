				<h1>HW6: System Calls and a User Process </h1>

<p>This homework asks you to extend your "hello world" kernel with support for
loading and executing a user process (as well as support for system calls). 
This assignments builds on top of your previous HW3, HW4, and HW5
submissions, i.e., you will extend the code of HW5. If you don't have a working HW5
submission talk to us. 

<p>
Technically, you can do this assignment on any
operating system that supports the Unix API and can run Qemu (CADE
machines, your laptop that runs Linux or Linux VM, and even MacOS, etc.).
<b>You don't need to set up xv6 for this assignment</b>, but <b>if you're running
on CADE you'll have to install QEMU</b>, see <a href="../xv6-setup.html">QEMU 
setup instructions</a>. Submit your programs
and the shell through Gradescope (see instructions at the bottom of this page). 

<p><b>NOTE: YOU CANNOT PUBLICLY RELEASE SOLUTIONS TO THIS HOMEWORK</b>. It's ok to show 
your work to your future employer as a private Git repo, however any public release is prohibited.

<h2> Part 1 - Syscall </h2>

<h3> User program </h3>

<p> You will be extending your previous "hello world" kernel. Since we will be building 
a user process we will need a new Makefile. Download it here: <a href="Makefile">Makefile</a>.
				
<p> Download the following files: <a href="syscall.c"> syscall.c </a>, <a href="syscall.h"> syscall.h </a>,
<a href="user/user.h"> user.h </a>, <a href="user/usys.asm"> usys.asm </a>, and 
<a href="user/user.c"> user.c </a>. Create <code>user</code> directory. 

<p>
Add everything to your proj so it look like this:


<pre>
- boot/
- Makefile
- syscall.c
- syscall.h
- ... other .c .h .asm files 
- user/
	  - user.c
	  - user.h
	  - usys.asm
</pre>
				
<p> The big picture of this project is to create our first process and be able to run a user program.
Let us take the top down approach, and understand what a user program is. A user program are just
a bunch of instructions that will be running in a special mode of CPU (ring 3). This means that
					<li>
						User instrutions run in user pages.
					</li>
					<li>
						Segmentation registers are pointing to User segments in GDT
					</li>
					<li>
						Stack lives in user pages
					</li>
				</p>
				
<p>
To be more specific, in order to run in user mode, we need to manage three data structures
					<li>
						Page table
					</li>
					<li>
						GDT
					</li>
					<li>
						TSS
					</li>
				</p>

<p> In a typical OS, user program can enter the kernel through
					<li>
						Hardware Interrupt (ex. Timer)
					</li>
					<li>
						Fault (aka. Exception)
					</li>
					<li>
						Software Interrupt (ex. Syscall)
					</li>

				</p>

<p> You can implement or design any system call you want, but the main goal
					is to provide isolation for the user program for certain important functionalities.
					Image that you install a minesweeper on your computer, and it have unlimited access to your network
					card and disk. Not good.
				</p>

<p> In our toy kernel, we will only implement two system calls:
<code>print()</code> and <code>exit()</code>.  The <code> print </code>
function will, as in its name, print to console. and <code> exit </code>
function is another way to return from user to kernel permantly. Those syscall,
by no way, is complete for a fully function kernel, but it will suffice for
this homework.  </p>


<p>In <code>user.c</code>, add following code (this is a very small user
program, it prints "hello user" on the screen and exits. But, hey, if you 
want to keep going, you can build anything you like (a realistic project is 
something like Tetris) </p>

<pre>
#include "user.h"

int main(void) 
{
	print("hello user\n"); 
	exit();
}
</pre>


<p> Now it is time to add definition for the two syscall we just add. In usys.asm, we already
implemented <code> print </code> for you. Observe, this is incredly simple, as user's job is
simply move a number into <code> eax </code> register, and then call interrupt at a specific
number. The number <code> T_SYSYCALL </code> indicates the IRQ number. The main idea here
is to interrupt to kernel at specific IRQ number, and have kernel to handle that as syscall.
</p>

<pre>
global print
print:
	mov eax, SYS_print
	int T_SYSCALL
	ret

</pre>

<p> Your job here is to finish the implementation of usys.asm by implementing <code> exit </code> in
	similar manner.
	Once it is done, you can call <code> make user </code> to check if there is any compilation error.
</p>


<h3> Trap: Revisited </h3>

<p>In order to supprot system calls in our minimal kernel, we need to add a couple of things. Let us first head to vectors.asm.
	You should already have some code in this file from previous homework. Now it is time to test your
	knowledge. In the user program, we wrote this line
<pre>
int T_SYSCALL
</pre>

This should trigger the cpu to start to execute at a specific vector like the timer ( which is at 32).
Your job here is to add another entry for vector at entry <code> T_SYSCALL </code>.
</p>

<p> Once you are modifying vectors.asm, now go to trap.c. You need to do two things

<ol>
	<li> Add entry correspond to T_SYSCALL for IDT with DPL_USER permission and select KCODE segment
	</li>
	<li> Handle tf->trapno for T_SYSCALL to invoke method <code> syscall </code>. </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p> At last, comment out printk(".") in your timer interrupt handling code. </p>

<h3> Syscall </h3>


<p> Let us go take a look at the <code> syscall </code> function in <a href="syscall.c">syscall.c</a>
	and you should see something like this </p>
<pre>
.... 

static int (*syscalls[])(void) = {
[SYS_print]    sys_print,
// TODO
};

void
syscall(struct trapframe *tf)
{
	uint num;

	current->tf = tf;

	num = current->tf->eax;
	if(num > 0 && num <= 2 && syscalls[num]) {

	// TODO: Invoke syscall correct syscall base on corresponding table entry
	// put the return result onto trap frame eax. 

	} else {
	current->tf->eax = -1;
	}
}
</pre>

<p> The <code> syscall </code> function will get current process (more on this later, now just see it as
	a global variable).
	The syscall table (variable named <code> syscalls </code>) is a just an array of function pointers
	with its function signture

<pre>
int func_name (void);
</pre>
</p>

<p> Recall that earlier in the user program,
	we wrote this line
<pre>
mov eax, #SOME_NUMBER
</pre>

By using eax pushed onto the trapframe, the kernel can know which corresponding function to call.
This number in the eax is exactly what the <code> syscalls </code> function table need to look up and
call it.
</p>

<p>Your job here is finish <code> syscall </code> function implementation and add
	<code> sys_exit </code> to the syscall table. This will complete the path of syscall from user to
	kernel.
</p>

<h2> Part 2 - Process </h2>
<p> Download
	<a href="elf.h"> elf.h </a>,
	<a href="proc.c"> proc.c </a>,
	<a href="proc.h"> proc.h </a>, and
	<a href="swtch.asm"> swtch.asm </a>. Add everything to your code base.
</p>

<p> We need to set up task state segment, add this to your <code> mmu.h </code></p>
<pre>
// Task state segment format
struct taskstate {
	uint link;         // Old ts selector
	uint esp0;         // Stack pointers and segment selectors
	ushort ss0;        //   after an increase in privilege level
	ushort padding1;
	uint *esp1;
	ushort ss1;
	ushort padding2;
	uint *esp2;
	ushort ss2;
	ushort padding3;
	void *cr3;         // Page directory base
	uint *eip;         // Saved state from last task switch
	uint eflags;
	uint eax;          // More saved state (registers)
	uint ecx;
	uint edx;
	uint ebx;
	uint *esp;
	uint *ebp;
	uint esi;
	uint edi;
	ushort es;         // Even more saved state (segment selectors)
	ushort padding4;
	ushort cs;
	ushort padding5;
	ushort ss;
	ushort padding6;
	ushort ds;
	ushort padding7;
	ushort fs;
	ushort padding8;
	ushort gs;
	ushort padding9;
	ushort ldt;
	ushort padding10;
	ushort t;          // Trap on task switch
	ushort iomb;       // I/O map base address
};

#define SEG16(type, base, lim, dpl) (struct segdesc)  \
{ (lim) & 0xffff, (uint)(base) & 0xffff,              \
	((uint)(base) >> 16) & 0xff, type, 1, dpl, 1,       \
	(uint)(lim) >> 16, 0, 0, 1, 0, (uint)(base) >> 24 }
</pre>

<h3> Main </h3>
<p> First, head to your <code> main.c </code>.

	Add two function <code> userinit </code> and <code> run_current </code> in main, like this: </p>

<pre>
void main() {
... // Set up paging and everything else. 

	tvinit();

	userinit(entry_pgdir);
	run_current(); 

	while(1)
		halt(); 
}
</pre>
<p> Both function definition are in <code> proc.c </code> file.
	userinit function will read the elf file to create a user process. and <code> run_current </code>
	function will
	context swtch to the only process. You don't need to touch <code> run_current </code> function. Your
	job
	will be understanding <code> userinit </code> and finish its implementation. </p>


<p>
	userinit is a long function, but it is mainly two part. The first part is elf loading. we first
	find the elf binary start address, which is a symbol that been added onto the kernel when we compile
	the user program by <code> objcopy </code> program. This will give us a elf struct, which we can use
	to load our simple user program like we did in hw2.
</p>

<p>
	The second part of userinit is the focus of this assignment. This part will be responsible for set
	up the process data structure correctly.
</p>

<pre>

void userinit(void)
{

	.... // Elf loading code

	p->pgdir = pgdir;
	p->kstack = (char *)page_alloc();
	memzero(p->kstack, PAGESIZE);
	
	char *sp;
	sp = p->kstack + PGSIZE;
	
	// TODO: Initilize kernel stack	
	// sp is your kernel stack pointer. 
	// put process trap frame and context on stack ( order matters !)
	
	// TODO: uncomment below to fill in ?s
	// p->tf->eip = ?
	// p->context->eip = ?
	
	p->tf->cs = (SEG_UCODE << 3) | DPL_USER;
	p->tf->ds = (SEG_UDATA << 3) | DPL_USER;
	p->tf->es = p->tf->ds;
	p->tf->ss = p->tf->ds;
	p->tf->eflags = FL_IF;


	..... // rest of code. 
}
</pre>

<p> The main idea of how to fill in the above code will be provided below, but you can also try reference
	<a href="https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public/blob/master/proc.c">xv6</a> for this part as alternative source.
</p>

<h3> Process </h3>
<p> Let us first take a look at and the process definition (see <a>proc.h</a>):
</p>
<pre>
struct proc
{
	uint sz;                 // Top address of this process
	char *kstack;            // Bottom of kernel stack for this process
	pde_t *pgdir;            // Page table
	enum procstate state;    // Process state
	struct context *context; // swtch() here to run process
	struct trapframe *tf;    // Trap frame for current syscall
};
</pre>
<p> Recall that, in order to execute the user program in ring 3,
	we need to do
	<li>
		Let user program run in user pages. Page table need to be switched.
	</li>
	<li>
		Segmentation registers are pointing to User segments in GDT. Segement selectors need to be
		updated.
	</li>
</p>

<p> In this homework, user process and kernel will share same pagetable, so this leaves us setting
	up segmentation register. we could manually write out this code, but xv6 does this in a interesting
	manner by using <code> trapret </code> to restore those register through trapret, but
	trapret to every process allocate. We will use this trick. so our process execution will
	look like this. (You can ignore low-level details of swtch function,
	But you need to know that swtch will return to <code> p->context->eip </code>)
</p>

				<pre>
swtch -> trapret -> usercode
</pre>

<p>
	In order to implement the above path of execution, we can do so by correctly
	set up process Kernel stack, we need to do following.
<ul>
	<li> Allocate memory for kernel stack </li>
	<li> Initialize Trap Frame and put on the kernel stack </li>
	<li> Initialize Process Context and put on the kernel stack </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p> The visualization of kernel stack would be something like, note address are fake</p>
<pre>
0x1000 	------------ 
	TRAP FRAME
	-----------
	CONTEXT
0x0000  -----------
</pre>

<p> Once the above is done, <code> run_current </code> will switch to the process context, and start 
execute eip, which will be <code> trapret </code> that restore essentail registers for the process 
and start to execute its usercode. </p>


<h2> Extra Credit (50%) </h2>

<p> Implement a simple scheduler, a process table, and yield system call, so that process can be 
	run concurrently. Note, you also need to create another user process to be loaded as part of your kernel. 
	Your process should yield back to kernel scheduler whenever timer interrupt happens.
</p>

<h3> Submission </h3>
Once you finish the guide, call
<pre> make qemu-nox </pre> as usual, you should see "hello user" message.
Submit all the files, please run
<pre> make clean </pre> and zip up all files to submit to gradescope. 
If you have extra credit implement, please put it under extra/ directory. 
We will grade it manually.

<p> Note: Comment out printk(".") in your timer interrupt handling code in trap.c, so it 
	doesn't mess with autograder.
