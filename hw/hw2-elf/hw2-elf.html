<h1>Homework 2: ELF files</h1>

<p>This assignment will make you more familiar with organisation of ELF files. Technically, you can do this assignment on any operating system that supports the Unix API (Linux
CADE machines, your laptop that runs Linux or Linux VM, and
even MacOS, etc.). <b>You don't need to set up xv6 for this assignment</b> 
Submit your programs and the shell through Gradescope (see instructions at
the bottom of this page). 

<p><b>NOTE: YOU CANNOT PUBLICLY RELEASE SOLUTIONS TO THIS HOMEWORK</b>. It's ok to show 
your work to your future employer as a private Git repo, however any public release is prohibited. 

For <b>Mac / OSX</b> users. The support of 32 bit applications is deprecated in the latest version of your system. So if you already updated your system to MacOS Catalina or have updated your XCode then we recommend you to do the homework at the CADE machines.

<h2>Part 1: Take a look at ELF files</h2> 

<p>Download the <a href="main.c">main.c</a>, and <a href="elf.c">elf.c</a>, and look over them. At a 
high level this homework asks you to implement a simple ELF loader (you will extend the <tt>main.c</tt> file) 
and use it to load a simple ELF object file (the one compiled from <tt>elf.c</tt>). However, before starting on this
lets make ourselves familiar with ELF files. 

<p>We provide a simple <a href="Makefile">Makefile</a> that compiles <tt>elf.o</tt> and <tt>main</tt> as 
ELF executables. Look over the makefile and then compile both files by running: 

<pre>make</pre>


Lets take a look at the ELF files we compiled. We will use the <tt>readelf</tt> tool

<pre>
$ readelf -a elf
</pre>

<p>ELF is the file format used for object files (<code>.o</code>'s), binaries, shared
libraries and core dumps in Linux.</p>

<p>It's actually pretty simple and well thought-out.</p>

<p>ELF has the same layout for all architectures, however endianness and word size
can differ; relocation types, symbol types and the like may have
platform-specific values, and of course the contained code is arch specific.</p>


<p>The ELF files are used by two tools: 1) linker and 2) loader. A linker combines multiple ELF files into an executable 
or a library and a loader loads the executable ELF file in the memory of the process. On real operating systems loading 
may require relocation (e.g., if the file is dynamically linked it has to be linked again with all the shared libraries 
it depends on). In this homework we will not do any relocation (it's too complicated), we'll simply load an ELF file in memory
and run it. 

<p>Linker and loader need two different views of the ELF file, i.e., they access it differently---the linker needs 
to know where the DATA, TEXT, BSS, and other sections are to merge them with sections from other libraries. If relocation is 
required the linker needs to know where the symbol tables and relocation information is. 

<p>The loader, however, does not need any of these details. It simply needs to know which parts of the ELF file are code (executable), 
which are data and read-only data, and where to put the BSS in the memory of a process. 

<p>Hence the ELF file provides two separate views on the data inside the ELF file: 1) a more detailed view for the linker, 
and 2) a bit more high-level view for the loader. To provide these view each ELF file contains two arrays: Section Header Table (for the linker), 
and Program Header Table (for the loader). Both tables are simply arrays of entries that contain information about each part of 
the ELF file (e.g., where the sections for the linker and section for the loader are inside the ELF file).

<p> Here is a simple figure of a typical ELF file that starts with the ELF header. The header contains pointers 
to the locations  of Section Header Table and Program Header Table within the ELF file. Then each tables have entries that point to 
the starting locations of individual sections and segments. 

<p>
<IMG SRC="./hw2-elf.png" WIDTH="550" ALT=""/> 

<p>Lets take a look at both arrays.

<h2>Linking view: Section Header Table (SHT)</h2>

<p>The Section Header Table is an array in which every entry contains a pointer to one of the sections of the ELF file. <b>It's a bit 
	annoying but the parts of the ELF file used by the linker are called "sections", and the parts used by the loader 
	are called "segments"</b> (my guess is that different CPU segments were configured in the past for each part of the program 
loaded in memory, hence the name "segments", for example, an executable CPU segment was created for the executable parts of the ELF file 
(i.e., one segment that contained all executable sections like .text, .init, etc.). 

<p>Also don't get confused: sections and segments overlap. I.e., typically multiple sections (.text, .init) are all contained in one 
executable segment. Confusing, huh? It will become clear soon. 

<p>Lets take a look at what inside the ELF file. Run this command

<pre>
readelf -a elf
</pre>


If you scroll down to the <b>Section headers</b> you will see all "sections" of the ELF file 
that the linker can use: 

<pre>

  p (processor specific)
</pre>

Since <tt>elf.c</tt> is a very simple program, it has only <tt>.text</tt> section (i.e., code 
of the program), a bunch of sections that contain debugging information, and a <tt> .symtab</tt> 
section that contains imported and exported symbols. 

<p>
Note, there is no <tt>.data</tt> or <tt>.bss</tt> sections for global variables (there are no globals in <tt>elf.c</tt>). 

<p>
Moreover, since we linked <tt>elf.c</tt> to be a static executable, it is linked to run 
at address 0x0 (the <tt>-Ttext 0</tt> tells the linker to relocate the executable at 
linking time to work at <tt>0x0</tt>): 

<pre>
elf: elf.o
        ld -m elf_i386 -N -e main -Ttext 0 -o elf elf.o 

elf.o: elf.c
        $(CC) -c -fno-pic -static -fno-builtin -ggdb -m32 -fno-omit-frame-pointer elf.c
</pre>

<p>The symbol table contains these symbols

<pre>
Symbol table '.symtab' contains 14 entries:
   Num:    Value  Size Type    Bind   Vis      Ndx Name
     0: 00000000     0 NOTYPE  LOCAL  DEFAULT  UND
     1: 00000000     0 SECTION LOCAL  DEFAULT    1
     2: 00000010     0 SECTION LOCAL  DEFAULT    2
     3: 00000000     0 SECTION LOCAL  DEFAULT    3
     4: 00000000     0 SECTION LOCAL  DEFAULT    4
     5: 00000000     0 SECTION LOCAL  DEFAULT    5
     6: 00000000     0 SECTION LOCAL  DEFAULT    6
     7: 00000000     0 SECTION LOCAL  DEFAULT    7
     8: 00000000     0 SECTION LOCAL  DEFAULT    8
     9: 00000000     0 FILE    LOCAL  DEFAULT  ABS elf.c
    10: 00000048     0 NOTYPE  GLOBAL DEFAULT    2 __bss_start
    11: 00000000    13 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT    1 main
    12: 00000048     0 NOTYPE  GLOBAL DEFAULT    2 _edata
    13: 00000048     0 NOTYPE  GLOBAL DEFAULT    2 _end
</pre>

The <tt>main</tt> is our function (it's <tt>FUNC</tt>, and <tt>GLOBAL</tt>), the <tt>__bss_start</tt>, <tt>_edata</tt>, and <tt>_end</tt> are 
added by the linker to mark the start and end of the BSS, TEXT, and DATA sections. 

<p>If we take a look at the <tt>main</tt> executable, the ELF file is more complicated.

<p>It contains all the section we've mentioned in class: <tt>.text</tt> (main code of 
the program), <tt>.data</tt> (data section for global variables), <tt>.rodata</tt> (data 
section for global read-only variables), <tt>.bss</tt> (uninitialized global variables), 
<tt>.init</tt> (init section to call the constructors that run before <tt>main()</tt>), 
<tt>.got</tt>(Global Offset Table), <tt>.plt</tt> (Procedure Linking Table for lazy linking 
of imported functions), and even the <tt>.interp</tt> (the section for the interpreter, i.e., 
the linker that links dynamically linked program before it runs, typically it's 
<tt>/lib/ld-linux.so.2</tt> on Linux systems.</p>

<h2>Execution view: Program Header Table (PHT)</h2>

<p>The Program Header Table contains information for the kernel on how to start the program. The
<code>LOAD</code> directives determinate what parts of the ELF file get mapped into program 
memory.

<p>Again, in our <tt>elf</tt> example the program header defines only two segments. And 
only one of them should be loaded by the operating system in memory to run. 

<pre>
Program Headers:
  Type           Offset   VirtAddr   PhysAddr   FileSiz MemSiz  Flg Align
  LOAD           0x000074 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00048 0x00048 RWE 0x4
  GNU_STACK      0x000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000 0x00000 RW  0x10
</pre>

The only loadable section is linked to run at address 0x0. We can inspect the <tt>elf</tt> binary 
with the <tt>objdump</tt> tool to see what is there: 

<pre>
$ objdump -d elf

elf:     file format elf32-i386

Disassembly of section .text:

00000000 <main>:
   0:	55                   	push   %ebp
   1:	89 e5                	mov    %esp,%ebp
   3:	8b 55 08             	mov    0x8(%ebp),%edx
   6:	8b 45 0c             	mov    0xc(%ebp),%eax
   9:	01 d0                	add    %edx,%eax
   b:	5d                   	pop    %ebp
   c:	c3                   	ret
</pre>

<p>Well, no surprises: it's the main function compiled into machine code.

<h2>Putting it all together: the ELF header</h2>

<p>Neither the SHT nor the PHT have fixed positions, they can be located anywhere
in an ELF file. To find them the ELF header is used, which is located at the
very start of the file.</p>

<p>The first bytes contain the elf magic <code>"\x7fELF"</code>, followed by the class ID (32
or 64 bit ELF file), the data format ID (little endian/big endian), the machine
type, etc.</p>

<p>At the end of the ELF header are then pointers to the SHT and PHT. Specifically, 
the Section Header Table which is used by the linker starts at byte 1120 in the ELF file, 
and the Program Header Table starts at byte 52 (right after the ELF header)</p>

<pre>
ELF Header:
  Magic:   7f 45 4c 46 01 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
  Class:                             ELF32
  Data:                              2's complement, little endian
  Version:                           1 (current)
  OS/ABI:                            UNIX - System V
  ABI Version:                       0
  Type:                              EXEC (Executable file)
  Machine:                           Intel 80386
  Version:                           0x1
  Entry point address:               0x0
  Start of program headers:          52 (bytes into file)
  Start of section headers:          1120 (bytes into file)
  Flags:                             0x0
  Size of this header:               52 (bytes)
  Size of program headers:           32 (bytes)
  Number of program headers:         2
  Size of section headers:           40 (bytes)
  Number of section headers:         12
  Section header string table index: 11
</pre>

<p>Finally, the entry point of this file is at address <tt>0x0</tt>. This is exactly 
what we told the linker to do --- link the program to run at address <tt>0x0</tt>. And this 
is where the <tt>main</tt> function of the <tt>elf.c</tt> file is shown in the objdump. 

<h2>Program loading in the kernel</h2>

<p>The execution of a program starts inside the kernel, in the <tt>exec("/bin/wc",...)</tt> system call
takes a path to the executable file. The kernel reads the ELF header and the program header table
(PHT), followed by lots of sanity checks.</p>

<p>The kernel then loads the parts specified in the <code>LOAD</code> directives in the PHT
into memory. If an <code>INTERP</code> entry is present, the interpreter is loaded too.
Statically linked binaries can do without an interpreter; dynamically linked
programs always need <code>/lib/ld-linux.so</code> as interpreter because it includes some
startup code, loads shared libraries needed by the binary, and performs
relocations.</p>

<p>Finally control can be transferred to the entry point of the program or to the interpreter, if
linking is required. </p>


<p>In case of a statically linked binary that's pretty much it, however with
dynamically linked binaries a lot more magic has to go on.</p>

<p>First the dynamic linker (contained within the interpreter) looks at the
<code>.dynamic</code> section, whose address is stored in the PHT.</p>
<p>There it finds the <code>NEEDED</code> entries determining which libraries have to be
loaded before the program can be run, the <code>*REL*</code> entries giving the address of
the relocation tables, the <code>VER*</code> entries which contain symbol versioning
information, etc.</p>

<p>So the dynamic linker loads the needed libraries and performs relocations
(either directly at program startup or later, as soon as the relocated symbol
is needed, depending on the relocation type).</p>

<p>Finally control is transferred to the address given by the symbol <code>_start</code> in
the binary. Normally some gcc/glibc startup code lives there, which in the end
calls <code>main()</code>.</p>

<h1>What you need to do in this homework: load an ELF file</h1>

<p>While ELF might look a bit intimidating, in practice the loading algorithm is trivial: 

<ol>
	<li>Read the ELF header (This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format">Wiki</a> page should help).
	<li>One of the ELF header fields tells you the offset of the program header table inside the file.
	<li>Read each entry of the program header table (i.e., read each program header)
	<li>Each program header has an offset and size of a specific segment inside the ELF file (e.g., 
		a executable code). You have to read it from the file and load it in memory. 

	<li>When done with all segments, jump to the entry point of the program. (Note since we don't control 
		layout of the address space at the moment, we load the sections at some random place in memory (the place 
		that is allocated for us by the <tt>mmap()</tt> function). Obviously the address of the entry point 
		should be an offset within that random area. Such loading will not work for a real ELF file, but 
		ours is simple: it's statically linked, and contains the code that can run at any location in memory. So even though 
		it's linked to run at <tt>0x0</tt> it will run anywhere where you load it. 
	
</ol>

<p>Looks manageable. We make a couple of simplifications. First we create a very simple ELF file out 
of <tt>elf.c</tt> --- it contains only one function, it has no data, and the code can be placed anywhere in 
memory and will run ok (it simply does not refer to any global addresses --- all variables are on the stack). 

<p>The <tt>main.c</tt> file provides definitions for the structs that match the ELF header and entries 
of the Program Header Table. So you can simply read the header out of the ELF file by using <tt>open</tt>,
<tt>lseek(fd, offset, SEEK_SET)</tt> to set the position of where to read to be <tt>offset</tt>, 
and <tt>read(fd, &elf, sizeof(elfhdr))</tt>, and then you can read the offset of the program header table, get the number of the 
entries in the program header table from the ELF header, and read all entries of the program header table one by one using <tt>lseek</tt>,
and <tt>read</tt> in a similar fashion as before. If the entry has <tt>ELF_PROG_LOAD</tt> 
type, you will load it in memory. 

<p>To load the segment in memory, you can allocate executable memory with the following function

<pre>
code_va = mmap(NULL, ph.memsz, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE | PROT_EXEC,
              MAP_ANONYMOUS | MAP_PRIVATE, 0, 0);
</pre>

where <tt>ph.memsz</tt> is the size of the segment that we currently are loading.  

<p>You should figure out where the entry point of your program is (it is in one of the segments, and since you map 
the segments at the addresses returned by the <tt>mmap()</tt> function, you need to find where it ends up in your 
address space. 

<p>If you found the entry point then type cast it to the function pointer that matches the function signature 
of the <tt>sum</tt> function and call it. 

<pre>
    if (entry != NULL) {
        sum = entry;
        ret = sum(1, 2);
        printf("sum:%d\n", ret);
    };
</pre>

Your program should take the name of the elf file as first argument and return the following result: 

<pre>
$ ./main elf
sum:3
</pre>
