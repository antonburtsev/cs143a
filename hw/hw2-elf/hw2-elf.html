<h1>Homework 2: ELF files</h1>

<p>This assignment will make you more familiar with organisation of ELF files. Technically, 
  you can do this assignment on any operating system that supports the Unix API (Linux
CADE machines, your laptop that runs Linux or Linux VM, and
even MacOS, etc.). <b>You don't need to set up xv6 for this assignment</b> 
Submit your programs and the shell through Gradescope (see instructions at
the bottom of this page). 

<p><b>NOTE: YOU CANNOT PUBLICLY RELEASE SOLUTIONS TO THIS HOMEWORK</b>. It's ok to show 
your work to your future employer as a private Git repo, however any public release is prohibited. 

For <b>Mac / OSX</b> users. The support of 32 bit applications is deprecated in the latest version of your system. So if you already updated your system to MacOS Catalina or have updated your XCode then we recommend you to do the homework at the CADE machines.

<h2>Part 1: Take a look at ELF files</h2> 

<p>At a high level this homework first shows you how to implement a simple ELF
loader <a href="./main.c">>main.c</a> file) (we use it to load a simple ELF
object file compiled from <a href="./elf.c">elf.c</a>), and then asks you to
relocate it to run at the address at which you load it.  However, before
starting on this lets make ourselves familiar with ELF files. 

<p>We provide a simple <a href="Makefile">Makefile</a> that compiles
<tt>elf</tt> and <tt>main</tt> as ELF executables. Look over the makefile and
then compile both files by running: 

<pre>make</pre>

Lets take a look at the ELF files we compiled. We will use the <tt>readelf</tt> tool

<pre>
$ readelf -a elf
</pre>

<p>ELF is the file format used for object files (<code>.o</code>'s), binaries, shared
libraries and core dumps in Linux.</p>

<p>It's actually pretty simple and well thought-out.</p>

<p>ELF has the same layout for all architectures, however endianness and word size
can differ; relocation types, symbol types and the like may have
platform-specific values, and of course the contained code is arch specific.</p>


<p>The ELF files are used by two tools: 1) linker and 2) loader. A linker combines multiple ELF files into an executable 
or a library and a loader loads the executable ELF file in the memory of the process. On real operating systems loading 
may require relocation (e.g., if the file is dynamically linked it has to be linked again with all the shared libraries 
it depends on). In this homework we will not do any relocation (it's too complicated), we'll simply load an ELF file in memory
and run it. 

<p>Linker and loader need two different views of the ELF file, i.e., they access it differently---the linker needs 
to know where the DATA, TEXT, BSS, and other sections are to merge them with sections from other libraries. If relocation is 
required the linker needs to know where the symbol tables and relocation information is. 

<p>The loader, however, does not need any of these details. It simply needs to know which parts of the ELF file are code (executable), 
which are data and read-only data, and where to put the BSS in the memory of a process. 

<p>Hence the ELF file provides two separate views on the data inside the ELF file: 1) a more detailed view for the linker, 
and 2) a bit more high-level view for the loader. To provide these view each ELF file contains two arrays: Section Header Table (for the linker), 
and Program Header Table (for the loader). Both tables are simply arrays of entries that contain information about each part of 
the ELF file (e.g., where the sections for the linker and section for the loader are inside the ELF file).

<p> Here is a simple figure of a typical ELF file that starts with the ELF header. The header contains pointers 
to the locations  of Section Header Table and Program Header Table within the ELF file. Then each tables have entries that point to 
the starting locations of individual sections and segments. 

<p>
<IMG SRC="./hw2-elf.png" WIDTH="550" ALT=""/> 

<p>Lets take a look at both arrays.

<h2>Linking view: Section Header Table (SHT)</h2>

<p>The Section Header Table is an array in which every entry contains a pointer to one of the sections of the ELF file. <b>It's a bit 
	annoying but the parts of the ELF file used by the linker are called "sections", and the parts used by the loader 
	are called "segments"</b> (my guess is that different CPU segments were configured in the past for each part of the program 
loaded in memory, hence the name "segments", for example, an executable CPU segment was created for the executable parts of the ELF file 
(i.e., one segment that contained all executable sections like .text, .init, etc.). 

<p>Also don't get confused: sections and segments overlap. I.e., typically multiple sections (.text, .init) are all contained in one 
executable segment. Confusing, huh? It will become clear soon. 

<p>Lets take a look at what inside the ELF file. Run this command

<pre>
readelf -a elf
</pre>


If you scroll down to the <b>Section headers</b> you will see all "sections" of the ELF file 
that the linker can use:

</pre>

The <tt>elf.c</tt> is a simple program, but it still has <tt>.text</tt>,
<code>.data</code>, <code>.bss</code>, and <code>.rel.text</code> (relocation)
sections and a bunch of sections that contain symbol information and a ton of
other stuff. 

<p> Since <code>elf.c</code> has two initialized and one uninitialized global
variables the ELF has data section of 8 bytes and the BSS section of 4 bytes
(each variable is a 4 byte integer). 

<p> The program is linked <tt>elf.c</tt> to run at address 0x08048000 which is 
the default program linking address on UNIX systems (the reasons are choosing this 
address are historical and not entirely clear but it is what it is (see this 
short email for some quesses <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/91985/">
Reorganizing the address space</a> 

<p>The symbol table contains the following symbols

<pre>
Symbol table '.symtab' contains 24 entries:
   Num:    Value  Size Type    Bind   Vis      Ndx Name
     0: 00000000     0 NOTYPE  LOCAL  DEFAULT  UND

    16: 080481d4     4 OBJECT  GLOBAL DEFAULT    9 b
    17: 08048124    32 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT    6 quadruple
    18: 080481d8     4 OBJECT  GLOBAL DEFAULT    9 c
    19: 080481dc     0 NOTYPE  GLOBAL DEFAULT   10 __bss_start
    20: 080481dc     4 OBJECT  GLOBAL DEFAULT   10 d
    21: 08048144    13 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT    6 magic
    22: 080481dc     0 NOTYPE  GLOBAL DEFAULT    9 _edata
    23: 080481e0     0 NOTYPE  GLOBAL DEFAULT   10 _end
</pre>

I.e., it contains names of the two functions <tt>quadruple</tt> and
<tt>magic</tt>, three global variables <tt>b</tt>, <tt>c</tt>, and <tt>d</tt>.
Other symbols like <tt>__bss_start</tt>, <tt>_edata</tt>, and <tt>_end</tt> are
added by the linker to mark the start and end of the BSS, TEXT, and DATA
sections. 


<h2>Execution view: Program Header Table (PHT)</h2>

<p>The Program Header Table contains information for the kernel on how to start the program. The
<code>LOAD</code> directives determinate what parts of the ELF file get mapped into program 
memory.

<p>In our <tt>elf</tt> example the program header defines four segments, but
only two of them should be loaded by the operating system in memory to run. 

<pre>
Program Headers:
  Type           Offset   VirtAddr   PhysAddr   FileSiz MemSiz  Flg Align
  LOAD           0x0000b4 0x080480b4 0x080480b4 0x00128 0x0012c RWE 0x4
  DYNAMIC        0x000154 0x08048154 0x08048154 0x00080 0x00080 RW  0x4
  NOTE           0x0000b4 0x080480b4 0x080480b4 0x00024 0x00024 R   0x4
  GNU_STACK      0x000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000 0x00000 RW  0x10
</pre>

The only loadable section is linked to be loaded at address 0x080480b4. We can also
look at the mappings of sections to segments (we will discuss what sections are below):


<pre>
 Section to Segment mapping:
  Segment Sections...
   00     .note.gnu.build-id .gnu.hash .dynsym .dynstr .rel.text .text .eh_frame .dynamic .data .bss
   01     .dynamic
   02     .note.gnu.build-id
   03
</pre>

In other works, inside the first loadable segment the linker placed the following 
sections: .note.gnu.build-id, .gnu.hash, .dynsym, .dynstr, .rel.text, .text, .eh_frame, .dynamic, .data, and .bss.

We can inspect the <tt>elf</tt> binary 
with the <tt>objdump</tt> tool to see what is inside the <code>.text</code> section: 

<pre>
$ objdump -d -M intel elf

elf:     file format elf32-i386


Disassembly of section .text:

08048124 <quadruple>:
 8048124:       55                      push   ebp
 8048125:       89 e5                   mov    ebp,esp
 8048127:       a1 d8 81 04 08          mov    eax,ds:0x80481d8
 804812c:       0f af 45 08             imul   eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8]
 8048130:       89 c2                   mov    edx,eax
 8048132:       8b 0d d4 81 04 08       mov    ecx,DWORD PTR ds:0x80481d4
 8048138:       a1 dc 81 04 08          mov    eax,ds:0x80481dc
 804813d:       0f af c1                imul   eax,ecx
 8048140:       01 d0                   add    eax,edx
 8048142:       5d                      pop    ebp
 8048143:       c3                      ret

08048144 <magic>:
 8048144:       55                      push   ebp
 8048145:       89 e5                   mov    ebp,esp
 8048147:       a1 d4 81 04 08          mov    eax,ds:0x80481d4
 804814c:       6b c0 0e                imul   eax,eax,0xe
 804814f:       5d                      pop    ebp
 8048150:       c3                      ret
</pre>

<p>Well, no surprises: it's the code of the two functions we defined in <code>elf.c</code>.

<h2>Putting it all together: the ELF header</h2>

<p>Neither the SHT nor the PHT have fixed positions, they can be located anywhere
in an ELF file. To find them the ELF header is used, which is located at the
very start of the file.</p>

<p>The first bytes contain the elf magic <code>"\x7fELF"</code>, followed by the class ID (32
or 64 bit ELF file), the data format ID (little endian/big endian), the machine
type, etc.</p>

<p>At the end of the ELF header are then pointers to the SHT and PHT. Specifically, 
the Section Header Table which is used by the linker starts at byte 256 in the ELF file, 
and the Program Header Table starts at byte 52 (right after the ELF header)</p>

<pre>
ELF Header:
  Magic:   7f 45 4c 46 01 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
  Class:                             ELF32
  Data:                              2's complement, little endian
  Version:                           1 (current)
  OS/ABI:                            UNIX - System V
  ABI Version:                       0
  Type:                              EXEC (Executable file)
  Machine:                           Intel 80386
  Version:                           0x1
  Entry point address:               0x8048124
  Start of program headers:          52 (bytes into file)
  Start of section headers:          1112 (bytes into file)
  Flags:                             0x0
  Size of this header:               52 (bytes)
  Size of program headers:           32 (bytes)
  Number of program headers:         4
  Size of section headers:           40 (bytes)
  Number of section headers:         15
  Section header string table index: 14
</pre>

<p>The entry point of this file is at address <tt>0x8048124</tt>. This is exactly 
what we told the linker to do --- make the function <code>quadruple</code> the entry point (
this is done with the following directive to the linker from the Makefile <code>-e quadruple</code>. 

<p>You might ask a question: why are we making the <code>quadruple</code> function to be the entry point? Otherwise, it's not <code>main</code>, and 
really nothing is special about this function. The reason is that it gives us the way to know where quadruple is in the text section so we 
can invoke it after loading the file. Without making it an entry point we would have to read the symbol table which is doable but would take some
additional time (we ask you to do this for an extra credit). 

<h2>Program loading in the kernel</h2>

<p>The execution of a program starts inside the kernel, in the <tt>exec("/bin/wc",...)</tt> system call
takes a path to the executable file. The kernel reads the ELF header and the program header table
(PHT), followed by lots of sanity checks.</p>

<p>The kernel then loads the parts specified in the <code>LOAD</code> directives in the PHT
into memory. After that the control can be transferred to the entry point of the program.</p>

<h1>Example: load an ELF file</h1>

<p>While ELF might look a bit intimidating, in practice the loading algorithm is rather simple: 

<ol>
	<li>Read the ELF header (This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format">Wiki</a> page should help).
	<li>One of the ELF header fields tells you the offset of the program header table inside the file.
	<li>Read each entry of the program header table (i.e., read each program header)
	<li>Each program header has an offset and size of a specific segment inside the ELF file (e.g., 
		a executable code). You have to read it from the file and load it in memory. 

	<li>When done with all segments, jump to the entry point of the program. (Note since we don't control 
		layout of the address space at the moment, we load the segments at some random place in memory (the place 
		that is allocated for us by the <tt>mmap()</tt> function). Obviously the address of the entry point 
		should be an offset within that random area.
</ol>

<p>The <tt>main.c</tt> <a href="./main.c">main.c</a> file implements the above. Take a look at this file. 

<p>There is a couple of interesting things going on in this file. First we do a loop through all loadable 
segments of the file and find the min and max virtual addresses at which the sections can be loaded. Segments 
can be out-of-order with respect to their virtual addresses and we want to know the range of the addresses that will be 
used in the end. 

<pre>
     size_t min_vaddr = SIZE_MAX;
     for (int i = 0; i < phnum; ++i) {
         if (phs[i].p_type != PT_LOAD) {
             continue;
         }
         if (phs[i].p_vaddr > max_vaddr) {
             max_vaddr = phs[i].p_vaddr;
         }
         if (phs[i].p_vaddr < min_vaddr) {
             min_vaddr = phs[i].p_vaddr;
         }
     }
</pre>

To load the segment in memory, we use mmap to get an executable memory from the OS. You can <tt> man mmap </tt> to read more. 

<pre>
// Allocate memory for object
void* load_base = mmap(NULL, page_align(max_vaddr - min_vaddr), PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE | PROT_EXEC,
          MAP_ANONYMOUS | MAP_PRIVATE, 0, 0);
</pre>

<p>Now we iterate through all segments in the program header and look for the loadable ones. 
 
<pre>
     // Load segments one by one
     for (int i = 0; i < phnum; i++) {
         Elf32_Phdr *ph = phs + i;
         if (ph->p_type != PT_LOAD) {
             continue;
         }

         size_t vaddr = ph->p_vaddr;
         size_t memsz = ph->p_memsz;
         size_t filesz = ph->p_filesz;
         size_t offset = ph->p_offset;

         void *segment_addr = (void*)((uint8_t*)load_base + vaddr - min_vaddr);

         LOG("Segment %#10x -> %#10p (memsz=0x%x, filesz=0x%x, offset=0x%x)\n", vaddr, segment_addr, memsz, filesz, offset);

         // Alternatively, mmap the file directly!
         fseek(f, offset, SEEK_SET);
         if ((items = fread(segment_addr, filesz, 1, f)) < 0) {
             ABORT("Failed to read segment %d: %s\n", i, strerror(errno));
         }
         if (items < 1) {
             ABORT("Segment %d is incomplete\n", i);
         }

         if (filesz < memsz) {
             // Sometimes filesz can be smaller than memsz, and the remaining
             // portion must be zero-initialized (e.g., .bss).
             void *zero_base = (void*)((uint8_t*)segment_addr + filesz);
             size_t zero_len = memsz - filesz;
             memset(zero_base, 0, zero_len);
         }
     }

</pre>

<p> Now we loaded the text section in memory, so we can take an entry point, assign it to the <code>quadruple</code> pointer, and call it. 

<pre>
     if (elf.e_entry) {
         quadruple = (int (*)(int))((uint8_t*)load_base + elf.e_entry - min_vaddr);
     }


     if (func) {
         ret = quadruple(4);
         printf("ret = %d\n", ret);
     }
</pre>

<p> 
If we run this program it can either crash or return an incorrect result. Our first goal is to understand why. 


<h1>Part 1: Explain the crash</h1>

<p><code>./main elf</code> crashed. The first part of the homework asks you to
explain the crash. Specifically, you should start the program under GDB like

<pre>gdb --args main elf</pre>

Refer to HW1 for how to set a breakpoint on main and start the program under
GDB. I recommend you to use TUI to see the source code and assembly of the
program.

<p>To switch the disassembly to the Intel syntax type

<pre>set disassembly-flavor intel</pre>

inside GDB. 

<p>To enable TUI type

<pre>layout split</pre>

to show both source code and assembly side by side.

<p>To explain the crash (or incorrect execution) you will need to understand what the code is doing at the level of the 
assemly code when you invoke the <code>quadruple</code> function. Specifically, you should explain which
instruction causes the crash and why. Or why the computed value is incorrect.  You will submit your explanation as a
text file on gradescope. 


<h1>Part 2: Relocation</h1>

<p> Now we're finally ready to start the second part of the assignment: relocating the loaded elf. Specifically, our goal is to
learn how to relocate a binary. In the step above we loaded the binary in
memory, but it crashes as it was linked to run at an address which is different
from the one we loaded it at. Below we will relocate <code>elf</code>
to run correctly by patching all references to the global variables that need
to be relocated. 

<!--

<p>  First, of all, the following wiki page will help you 
with the code of almost a complete solution <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/ELF_Tutorial">
ELF Tutorial</a>. If you want to cross check your code against an
existing implementation, go for it. Note though that we're doWe, however try to stitch it ourself to
gain a bit of understanding. 

-->

<p>To preform the relocation, we need to access the relocation table (a table inside the 
ELF file that contains all information for how to do the relocation). 

<p>
To access the relocation table, we  first read the section header
table. 

<pre>
     // Read section headers
     if (elf.e_shentsize != sizeof(Elf32_Shdr)) {
         ABORT("File has unexpected section header size: %d\n", elf.e_shentsize);
     }
     size_t shnum   elf.e_shnum;
     size_t shtotal = shnum * elf.e_shentsize;
     Elf32_Shdr *shs = (Elf32_Shdr*)load_multiple(f, elf.e_shoff, shtotal, sizeof(Elf32_Shdr), NULL);

     size_t relnum;
     Elf32_Rel *rels = NULL;


     for (int i = 0; i < elf.e_shnum; i++) {
         Elf32_Shdr *sh = shs + i;

         switch (sh->sh_type) {
             case SHT_REL: {
                 if (rels) {
                     ABORT("Loading multiple relocation sections isn't supported\n");
                 }
                 rels = (Elf32_Rel*)load_multiple(f, sh->sh_shoff, sh->sh_size, sizeof(Elf32_Rel), &relnum);
                 LOG("Loaded relocation table\n");
                 break;
             }

         }
     }
     free(shs);
</pre>

<p>
The section table contains a number of entries that contain various
information used by the linker (as we discussed above). Specifically, each
entry has the following C type definition: 

<pre> 
typedef struct {
	Elf32_Word	sh_name;
	Elf32_Word	sh_type;
	Elf32_Word	sh_flags;
	Elf32_Addr	sh_addr;
	Elf32_Off	sh_offset;
	Elf32_Word	sh_size;
	Elf32_Word	sh_link;
	Elf32_Word	sh_info;
	Elf32_Word	sh_addralign;
	Elf32_Word	sh_entsize;
} Elf32_Shdr;
</pre>

The <code>sh_type</code> defines the type of the entry. The following types are
defined by the ELF standard: 

<pre>
# define SHN_UNDEF	(0x00) // Undefined/Not present
 
enum ShT_Types {
	SHT_NULL	= 0,   // Null section
	SHT_PROGBITS	= 1,   // Program information
	SHT_SYMTAB	= 2,   // Symbol table
	SHT_STRTAB	= 3,   // String table
	SHT_RELA	= 4,   // Relocation (w/ addend)
	SHT_NOBITS	= 8,   // Not present in file
	SHT_REL		= 9,   // Relocation (no addend)
};
 
enum ShT_Attributes {
	SHF_WRITE	= 0x01, // Writable section
	SHF_ALLOC	= 0x02  // Exists in memory
};
</pre>

<p>To relocate a file we will have to iterate through all section header entries of our ELF file 
and pick the one that has the <code>SHT_REL</code> type (there is another relocation type  <code>SHT_RELA</code> but 
for simplicity we don't care about it in this homework). 

<p>
Relocation entires in the table are continuous
and the number of entries in a given table can be found by dividing the size of
the table (given by <code>sh_size</code> in the section header) by the size of each entry
(given by <code>sh_entsize</code>). 

<p>
In practice, each relocation table is specific to a single section,
so a single file may have multiple relocation tables (but all entries within a
given table will be the same relocation structure type). In our case we will only deal 
with one relocation table. And abort the code if we see another one: 

<pre>
if (rels) {
    ABORT("Loading multiple relocation sections isn't supported\n");
}
</pre>

<p>Each relocation entry has the following type: 

<pre>
typedef struct {
	Elf32_Addr		r_offset;
	Elf32_Word		r_info;
} Elf32_Rel;
</pre>

The value stored in <code>r_info</code>, as the upper byte
designates the entry in the symbol table to which the relocation applies,
whereas the lower byte stores the type of relocation that should be applied.

<pre>
#define ELF32_R_TYPE(val) ((val) & 0xff)
#define ELF32_R_SYM(val)  ((val) >> 8)
</pre>
 
<p>
We use the following macros to access type and symbol table entry. 

<p>
The value in <code>r_offset</code> gives the relative position of the symbol that is
being relocated, within its section.

<p> The real messy part about relocation is that there can be different kinds
of relocation actions. You can find the complete list defined by the ELF
standard here: <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19120-01/open.solaris/819-0690/chapter6-26/index.html">32-bit x86: Relocation Types</a>. 
We define just two types below: 

<pre>
#define R_386_32          1               // Direct 32 bit
#define R_386_RELATIVE    8               // Adjust by program base
</pre>

<p>Many types of relocation require accessing the relocation value stored in the symbol table. For
example, the <code>R_386_32</code> relocation type requires you to read the value (addend) from the 
relocation address specified by the <code>r_offset</code> field of the relocation entry and add it to 
the value (symbol) stored in the symbol table that corresponds to the symbol being relocated (i.e., 
pointed by the <code>ELF32_R_SYM(r_info)</code>. 

<p>In our example, the <code>elf</code> is compiled to require the <code>R_386_RELATIVE</code> relocation. 
Specifically, this relocation type just asks you to read the  value (addend) from the 
relocation address specified by the <code>r_offset</code> field of the relocation entry and add it to the base address at which the 
ELF is loaded. This is simple -- no need to access the symbol table, just read the value that is 
already there, add the base address and write it back. 

<p> Just to illustrate it with an example of relocating the access to
<code>b</code> in the <code>magic</code> function:

<pre>
08048144 <magic>:
 8048144:       55                      push   ebp
 8048145:       89 e5                   mov    ebp,esp
 8048147:       a1 d4 81 04 08          mov    eax,ds:0x80481d4
 804814c:       6b c0 0e                imul   eax,eax,0xe
 804814f:       5d                      pop    ebp
 8048150:       c3                      ret
</pre>

Right now <code>b</code> is in the data section at address
<code>0x80481d4</code>. 

<p>The relocation table contains the following entries

<pre>
$ readelf -r elf

Relocation section '.rel.text' at offset 0x104 contains 4 entries:
 Offset     Info    Type            Sym.Value  Sym. Name
08048128  00000008 R_386_RELATIVE
08048134  00000008 R_386_RELATIVE
08048139  00000008 R_386_RELATIVE
08048148  00000008 R_386_RELATIVE
</pre>

<p>For example the last entry tells us that <code>magic</code> tries to access <code>b</code>
at address <code>0x08048148</code> which is exactly where the <code>mov</code> instruction 
tries to load <code>b</code>:

<pre>
8048147:       a1 d4 81 04 08          mov    eax,ds:0x80481d4
</pre>

<p>
The code was supposed to be loaded at address 0x080480b4 but since we loaded it
at address we've got from <code>mmap()</code> (i.e., the <code>load_base</code> in our code) 
we will relocate by (<code>load_base - min_vaddr</code>). Also, note that the offsets are in the virtual address 
space of the program, but since we loaded the segments starting from <code>load_base</code> you have to 
compute the correct offsets making sure they point into the loaded code in memory. 

<h2> Ready to relocate </h4>

For our relocatable ELF file to run correctly we need to process all relocation entries present in the file. 
At a high level our algorithm is the following: 

<ol>
  <li> Read the elf header (similar to how we do this to read the program header). 
  <li> Read the section header table. 
  <li> Iterate over all section headers finding the ones that has type <code>SHT_REL</code> (i.e., the relocation table).
  <li> Once found you iterate through all entries in the relocation table (remember it will have <code>sh_size/sh_entsize</code> entries) and they will be of type <code>Elf32_Rel</code>
  <li> For each entry perform relocation

</ol>

You have to fill in the code in this section of the <a href="main.c">main.c</a> file: 

<pre>
    // Read section headers
    if (elf.e_shentsize != sizeof(Elf32_Shdr)) {
        ABORT("File has unexpected section header size: %d\n", elf.e_shentsize);
    }
    size_t shnum   elf.e_shnum;
    size_t shtotal = shnum * elf.e_shentsize;
    Elf32_Shdr *shs = (Elf32_Shdr*)load_multiple(f, elf.e_shoff, shtotal, sizeof(Elf32_Shdr), NULL);

    size_t relnum;
    Elf32_Rel *rels = NULL;


    for (int i = 0; i < elf.e_shnum; i++) {
        Elf32_Shdr *sh = shs + i;

        switch (sh->sh_type) {
            case SHT_REL: {
                if (rels) {
                    ABORT("Loading multiple relocation sections isn't supported\n");
                }
                rels = (Elf32_Rel*)load_multiple(f, sh->sh_shoff, sh->sh_size, sizeof(Elf32_Rel), &relnum);
                LOG("Loaded relocation table\n");
                break;
            }

        }
    }
    free(shs);

    if (rels) {
        for (int j = 0; j < relnum; ++j) {
            Elf32_Rel *rel = rels + j;

            uint8_t r_type = ELF32_R_TYPE(rel->r_info);

            // YOUR CODE HERE

        }

        free(rels);
    }
    fclose(f);
