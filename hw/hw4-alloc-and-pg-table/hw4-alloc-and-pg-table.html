<h1>Homework 4: Page memory allocator and an address space</h1>

<p>This assignment will teach you to implement a simple page memory allocator 
and how to construct a simple address space. <b>This assignments builds on top of your 
previous HW3 submission (Boot Into C)</b>, i.e., you will extend the code of HW3 
to implement this additional functionality for HW4. If you don't have a working HW3 submission 
talk to us. 

<p>
Technically, you can do this assignment on any
operating system that supports the Unix API and can run Qemu (CADE
machines, your laptop that runs Linux or Linux VM, and even MacOS, etc.).
<b>You don't need to set up xv6 for this assignment</b>, but <b>if you're running
on CADE you'll have to install QEMU</b>, see <a href="../xv6-setup.html">QEMU 
setup instructions</a>. Submit your programs
and the shell through Gradescope (see instructions at the bottom of this page). 

<p><b>NOTE: YOU CANNOT PUBLICLY RELEASE SOLUTIONS TO THIS HOMEWORK</b>. It's ok to show 
your work to your future employer as a private Git repo, however any public release is prohibited. 


<h2>Overview</h2>

At a high level our goal is to learn how to construct an address space, i.e., a
page table that we can use to load a program in memory. Don't forget, our
ultimate goal is to execute programs. (Not surprisingly, loading and executing
a program in memory will be our next homework, but today the things are simple,
we only construct an address space). 

To construct the address space we need two building blocks: 1) a memory
allocator that keeps track of available pages, and 2) a function that allows us
to map a physical page at a specific virtual address. Below, we learn how to
build the two. 

<h2>Page memory allocator</h2>

Our first task is to implement a simple page memory allocator. At a high level
your assignment is to implement two functions: <code>page_alloc()</code> and
<code>page_free(int pa)</code>. The <code>int page_alloc()</code> function should
return a physical address of a free page as integer. Similarly,
<code>page_free(int pa)</code> takes a physical address of the page and adds it
back to the pool of free physical pages. 

<p> Now, we need a way to keep track of available physical pages. We will implement 
this data structure as an array (each element of the array represents one physical 
page) linked with a list so we can quickly allocate the next available page.

Specifically, we will use the following data structure to keep track of 
physical pages in the system:

<pre>
#define MAX_PAGES 8
#define NIL 0xFFFFFFFF

struct page {
    unsigned int next;
};

struct free_pages {
    unsigned int head;
    struct page pages[MAX_PAGES];
};

unsigned int page_alloc(); 
void page_free(unsinged int pa); 
</pre>


Here the pages array tracks the state of every page in the system. Each 
element of the array corresponds to a single page. Page with physical page number (ppn) of 
0 (address 0x0), is element 0 of the array, ppn 1 is element 1, etc. The next field links the 
free pages as illustrated below (the example for MAX_PAGES of 8).
 
The head points to the 5th element of the array (this means that page with ppn 5 is 
free, and the next page on the list is page with ppn 1, and the last page on the list is 
page with ppn 3. Here we use NIL (a constant that identifies an invalid next pointer) to specify the end of the list. 

<pre>
head: 5 --------------+     
              +---+   |     
              |   |   |  
              |   v   v     
           -----------------
           | |3| |N| |1| | |
           -----------------
            0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 
              ^       |     
	      |       |
              +-------+

</pre>

The <code>page_alloc()</code> function should return physical address of the page with ppn 5, 
and will update the list like this: 

<pre>
head: 1 -+     
         |    +---+        
         |    |   |     
         |    |   v        
         | -----------------
         | | |3| |N| | | | |
         | -----------------
         |  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 
         |    ^
         |    |            
         +----+
</pre>

The <code>page_free(unsigned int pa)</code> function takes the physical address of the page, and adds this page 
back to the free list. For example, if you invoke <code>page_free(0x7000)</code> the list changes like: 

<pre>
head: 7 ------------------+     
              +---+       | 
              |   |       |
              |   v       v 
           -----------------
           | |3| |N| | | |1|
           -----------------
            0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 
              ^           |
              |           | 
              +-----------+
</pre>


You assignment is to implement this linked list to support 32MB of physical memory. Similar to 
xv6 you should add the <code>end</code> symbol to your kernel (remember, you have to change the 
linker script to export this symbol, and an extern declaration in C), add pages from the 
kernel end to the 32MB to your allocator.  


<h2>Mapping a page</h2>

<p>Having a memory allocator working, we are ready to construct the address space (i.e., a page 
table) with our new mapping function:

<pre>
int mmap(pte_t *pgdir, unsigned int va, unsigned int pa)
</pre>

This function takes a pointer to the page table directory and maps
the page with the physical address pa to the virtual address pa. If the inner levels of the page 
table are not present you should allocate and add them to the page table. 

Your assignment is to implement the <code>mmap()</code> function and map all memory from 0 to 32MB 
one to one, i.e., same virtual adddresses to same physical addresses (virtual address 0 to physical 
address 0, virtual address 4096 to physical address 4096, and so on).
 
<h2>Hints</h2>

To finish the homework you can follow the code of xv6 (in fact it's allowed to copy and paste code from 
xv6 verbatim if it helps you).
